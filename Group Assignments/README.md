## Research Question
The research question we will explore is: What kinds of lands are protected with conservation easements in California? Specifically, are the lands designated by the state as "important farmland" protected under easement; and What kinds of vegetation is there on easement lands?

## Why is it important
We think this is an important issue because the conservation of land is an important part of mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change. Natural and working lands function as carbon sinks because they sequester carbon in the soil and plant biomass, plus the plants take carbon from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. Land preservation limits the amount of land that can be developed, theoretically reducing sprawl (which creates a lot of GHGs) and the exposure of urban development to natural disasters (which are also exacerbated by climate change). Hopefully, the preservation of a habitable planet is important to others. If not, a more specific benefit in California is the protection of our food system, which we depend on to eat but also is a significant part of the state economy. Another is the preservation of California's unique habitats and wildlife.

## Spatial Scope 
The spatial scope is the entire state of California. While this may prove too large to take on in this project, land conservation and easements do not fit neatly within jurisdictional boundaries. California also has climate change laws and targets where the entire state is the unit of analysis, including a recent executive order signed by Governor Newsom to conserve 30% of California's land by 2030. 

## Data Sources:
### CCED California Conservation Easement Database
The CCED is a GIS database that includes easements and deed-based restrictions on private land in California. It includes easements held by land trusts, nonprofits, local jurisdictions, state agencies, and national agencies. It excludes temporary easements which are in place for less than 10 years. Some of the columns in the dataset include who the easementholder is, if the land has public access, the year the easement was established, and the shapefile information.

### California Important Farmland: 2016
This database is essentially an inventory of agricultural resources in the state. It is part of the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program that reports biennially on the conversion of farmland to grazing land. Some of the columns in the dataset include what type of farmland the piece of land is, the county where it's located, and the shapefile information. This specific dataset is from 2016 because the 2018 version is not fully updated. There is the potential to do something with time on this subject because there is data for every two years as far back as 2000.

### LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type
This database represents the current distribution of plant community types on the land. The dataset covers the entire United States.
